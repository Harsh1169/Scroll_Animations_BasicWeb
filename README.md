Interactive Web Experience
This project showcases a dynamic, single-page web experience built using a combination of foundational web technologies and popular JavaScript libraries for advanced animation and scrolling effects.

Features
Smooth Scrolling: Implemented with Locomotive Scroll for a fluid, parallax-like scroll experience.

Scroll-based Animation: Uses GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) and ScrollTrigger to drive a video-like image sequence animation on the canvas as the user scrolls.

Looping Text Animation: A horizontally looping text banner created with CSS keyframes.

Full-Screen Sections: Each section of the page fills the viewport, creating an immersive, full-screen layout.

Fixed Navigation: A static navigation bar that remains visible as the user scrolls.

Technologies Used
HTML: Provides the core structure and links to external resources.

CSS: Handles all styling, including layout, typography, and animations.

JavaScript: The main logic for handling animations and scroll effects.

Locomotive Scroll: A library for creating smooth, custom scrolling.

GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform): A high-performance animation library.
